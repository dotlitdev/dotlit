# Client
The static html generated by `.lit` does not *require* JavaScript to function for the reader[^1]. But by default includes a client bundle which re-hydrates the page to become fully interactive, enabling editing of the original document in place. See [[components/components]] for implementation details.

[^1]: One lingering exception is transclude. At the very least a link to the file being transcluded should be present, but even this is not *yet* the case.

```jsx #implementation !collapse < index.jsx

```
