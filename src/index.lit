`.lit` is a plain text document format. It's really just **Markdown**, but with a few key differences... or rather interpretations. With an aim to maintain backward compatibility with Markdown.

The first of the liberties to be taken is `Code` blocks, pulling the fenced code block to a first class citizen with super powers.

A less ambitious one is that Headlines naturally form *Sections*, and blocks of content coalesce into *Cells*.

That and `.lit` outputs to html but as a default these self-contained documents are their own editors, with full access to their own AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). With a Notebook which represents a collection/graph of interlinked files.


## [`Parser`](parser/parser.lit)

Build atop the [[unified]] ecosystem, specifically [[remark]], and [[rehype]], which takes `.lit` [[Markdown]] source and outputs `.lit` AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)

## [`Renderer`](renderer/renderer.lit)

The default render output is `html` which includes client-side `javascript` which hydrates a React application.

## [`CLI (Command Line)`](cli/cli.lit)

So far the only functionality available via the cli is `generate`
