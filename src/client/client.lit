# Client
The static html generated by `.lit` does not *require* JavaScript to function for the reader. But by default includes a client bundle which re-hydrates the page to become fully interactive, enabling editing of the original document in place. See [[components/components]] for implementation details.

```jsx #implementation !collapse < index.jsx
