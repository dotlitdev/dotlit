# Plant `uml`

Uses [plantuml.com](https://plantuml.com) to create `svg` images from `uml` source. Not included as a default viewer due to the external dependency, but it's great!

*Examples:*

```uml !below
class Dummy {
  String data
  void methods()
}
```
```uml !below
actor user
component service
user --> service
service --> user
```
