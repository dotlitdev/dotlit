# Time to Pudding

One of the recurring themes I've encountered whilst building/using `.lit` which had not been an explicit goal at the start, is the time it takes, from starting to think about a problem... teasing out potential solutions, to knowing if a solution works.

*As they say...*
> The proof is in the pudding.

While this is one of the core benefits of [[REPLs]] and [[Interactive Notebooks]]...

I propose that while there are many metrics by which people choose to grade their engineering endeavours, you should consider your Time to Pudding and how you can reduce it.
