# Local and Remote files

On load `.lit` determines the `src` and `root` and checks both local file system ([[LightningFS]]) and the remote host (ie GitHub pages, or local/remote server) and compares `last-updated` (or Stat `mtimeMs` in the case of local filesystem)

The problem is, that deployment to GitHub pages results in a remote file that *seems* newer than the local file that created it.

## Potential solutions

- Disable (appropriately) GitHub Pages cache

- Read from api instead of pages static file server when Authenticated
  - Potentially read and write to `gh-pages` directl, eschewing Actions deployment entirely.
