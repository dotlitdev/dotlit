    > 
    > Abstract
    > 
    >    OpenPGP is a message format for email (and file) encryption that
    >    lacks a standardized lookup mechanism to securely obtain OpenPGP
    >    public keys.  DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) is a
    >    method for publishing public keys in DNS.  This document specifies a
    >    DANE method for publishing and locating OpenPGP public keys in DNS
    >    for a specific email address using a new OPENPGPKEY DNS resource
    >    record.  Security is provided via Secure DNS, however the OPENPGPKEY
    >    record is not a replacement for verification of authenticity via the
    >    "web of trust" or manual verification.  The OPENPGPKEY record can be
    >    used to encrypt an email that would otherwise have to be sent
    >    unencrypted.
