# [[ðŸ”¬ Testing]] Section grouping

Pseudo code steps, operating during `parse` of standard `mdast`.

- With a stack initialised with root node (with children removed) ie `[root]`
- Iterate over all removed root chilren (in reverse? TBD) as `node`
  - define `section` as top of stack
  - if `section` is `root`
    - create section with `node` depth or 0.
    - add `node` as child of section
    - push section to children of node at the top of stack
    - push section to top of stack
  - else if `node` is a `heading`
    - with deeper depth?
      - create section with `node` depth
      - add `node` as child of section
      - push section to children of node at the top of stack
      - push section to top of stack
    - else
      - for each section in stack until top of stack has depth equal to or lower (shallower) than `node` depth.
        - pop stack and call process handler on popped section
      - create section with `node` depth
      - add `node` as child of section
      - push section to children of node at the top of stack
      - push section to top of stack
  - else add `node` to `section`
  - if no next node
    - for each section in stack until but not including root
      - pop stack and call process handler on popped section

## Cells

- given a set of nodes (generally children of a `section`)
- define an empty stack `[]`
- for each node in nodes
  - if node type is section push to top of stack
  - else if node type is a code 
    - if previous cell is a code cell and node is attached
      - push node as child of code cell at top of stack
    - else
      - create new cell with node as first child
      - push cell to top of stack
  - else if stack is empty or top of stack is a section or code cell
    - create new cell with node as first child
    - push cell to top of stack
  - else push node to children of cell at top of stack
