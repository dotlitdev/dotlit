# [[ðŸ”¬ Testing]] Section grouping

Pseodo code steps, operating during `parse` of standard `mdast`.

- With a stack initialised with root node (with children removed) ie `[root]`
- define `currentSection` as `null`
- Iterate over all removed root chilren (in reverse? TBD) as `node`
  - if `currentSection` is null
    - create with `node` depth or 0.
    - add `node` as child of `currentSection`
  - else if `node` is a `heading`
    - with deeper depth?
    - with shallower depth?
    - with equal depth?
  - else add to `currentSection`
