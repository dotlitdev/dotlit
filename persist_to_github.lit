# Persist to GitHub

Assuming you generate a personal access token and store it in `localStorage`.

See Help > GitHub Token

```js
localStorage.setItem('ghToken', 'YOUR_TOKEN')
```

Then, thanks to the below, it should just-work™️.

```js !collapse remote=true < utils/fs-promises-gh-utils.js
load source
```
```js
localStorage.setItem('ghToken', 'YOUR_TOKEN')
```
