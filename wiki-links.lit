# wiki-links

Wiki links, that is, non standard markdown links borrowed from it's namesakes Wiki.

Favoured for their simplicity to write, being plain text within double square brackets, ie `[[link title]]`.

The idea being that the "slug"ified link is canonical and not requiring qualification.

## Benefits

With their seeming simplicity comes some issues...
