    > True interactive development is programming by directly working on your program as it runs. As you do, you find yourself recompiling functions, methods, and whole classes, on the fly. Each change you make is immediately and automatically a part of the live program. When you are programming interactively, you are not so much writing code as sculpting and structuring live computer memory.

    > Tangle reminds me of mavo.io, although tango is older. I think Mavo aims for more UI heavy stuff (display and editing of structured data) and can read/write a backing store.
    > I thought I saw something else very similar to tangle years ago, but maybe it was tangle. It'd be interesting to try to do something like tangle from a markdown source.
    > From the web page, Patera looks similar to coda.io - a wysiwyg editor that tries to expand spreadsheet-like programming to documents.
