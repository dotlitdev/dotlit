    > Trust and a large variety of other semi-private communities—from pay-to-enter-discords, game guilds, blockchain communities, subscription-mediated newsletters, and group chats— are what Yancey Strickler calls Dark Forests. According to him these are “spaces where depressurized conversation is possible because of their non-indexed, non-optimized, and non-gamified environments”. Ribbonfarm’s Venkatesh Rao has another term for it: “the cozyweb works on the (human) protocol of everybody cutting-and-pasting bits of text, images, URLs, and screenshots across live streams”. Where dark forests are characterised by their intentional withdrawal from social media, the cozyweb is non-indexable because of a lacking interconnection between material, creating unintentionally disconnected islands populated by isolated communities.
