    > Why Wikilinks?
    > We all heavily use Wikipedia to learn. It just works. Actively contributing to it, on the other hand, is not that popular. Creating and managing a wiki quickly gets you deep into coding territory with sci-fi nomenclature, intimidating user interfaces, and alienating programming requirements. That’s a shame.
    > Wikis allow you to add everything you read and write to a body of ideas that live and grow. You can connect your thoughts and learnings, make them easily findable and thus build a living web of articles, notes, research, and ideas. Once you start connecting your documents, you simply do not want to go back to static files. Markdown and wikis will never be as popular as ice cream. But they should be as appealing and easy to get into for everyone that takes notes, researches, and writes professionally.
