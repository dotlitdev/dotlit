# 2022

- [x] fixed github token auth permanance by writing a clientside encrypted personal access token to .github_token and fixed a bug which prevented all `.dotfiles` from not being deployed. so now once initial setup is complete, reauth on local syorage clear is just a passord check used to redecrypt the persisted token. see [[testing/web_crypto_api|ðŸ”¬ Web Crypto API]]
- [x] Added auto completion of [[wiki-links|wiki-links]]
