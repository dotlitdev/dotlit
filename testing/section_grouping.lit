# [[ðŸ”¬ Testing]] Section grouping

Pseodo code steps:

- With a stack initialised with root node (with children romoved) ie `[root]`
- define `currentSection` as `null`
- Iterate over all removed root node chilren (in reverse? TBD) as `node`
  - if `currentSection` is null
    1. ceate with node depth or 0.
  1. if `node` is a `heading`
    1. with deeper depth?
    1. with shallower depth?
    1. with equal depth?
  1. add to `currentSection`
