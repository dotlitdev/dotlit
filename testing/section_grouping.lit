# [[ðŸ”¬ Testing]] Section grouping

Pseodo code steps:

- With a stack initialised with root node (with children romoved) ie `[root]`
- define `currentSection` as `null`
- Iterate over all removed root node chilren (in reverse? TBD) as `node`
  - if `currentSection` is null
    - ceate with node depth or 0.
  - if `node` is a `heading`
    - with deeper depth?
    - with shallower depth?
    - with equal depth?
  - add to `currentSection`
