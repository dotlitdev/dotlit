# [[ðŸ”¬ Testing]] Section grouping

Pseodo code steps, operating during `parse` of standard `mdast`.

- With a stack initialised with root node (with children removed) ie `[root]`
- Iterate over all removed root chilren (in reverse? TBD) as `node`
  - define `section` as top of stack
  - if `section` is `root`
    - create section with `node` depth or 0.
    - add `node` as child of section
    - push section to top of stack
  - else if `node` is a `heading`
    - with deeper depth?
      - create section with `node` depth
      - add `node` as child of section
      - push section to top of stack
    - else
      - pop the stack until top of stack has depth equal to or lower (shallower) than `node` depth.
      - create section with `node` depth
      - add `node` as child of section
      - push section to top of stack
  - else add `node` to `section`
